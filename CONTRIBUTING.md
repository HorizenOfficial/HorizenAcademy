# Horizen Academy Contributing Guidelines

üôèFirst off, thanks for taking the time to help out!üôè

The Horizen Academy has the purpose to be a valuable resource for all people interested in learning about blockchain technology and online privacy, as well as the Horizen software platform itself. You can find the current version of the Horizen Academy [here](https://academy.horizen.global).

This is not your standard code-focused project, therefore this is also not your standard CONTRIBUTING.md.

The following list is a set of guidelines, for contributing to the Horizen Academy - from fixing typos to creating entirely new articles.

## I don't want to read all this I just want to fix a typo!

We have created a very simple guide on [How to fix a typo?](HOW_TO_FIX_TYPOS.md). No matter if you are on GitHub for the very first time, this guide will make it easy for you to make your first open-source contribution. 
If you already know how GitHub works, just do your think - fork, fix, PR.
