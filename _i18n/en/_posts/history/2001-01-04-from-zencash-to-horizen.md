### The Birth of ZenCash

    <img src="{{site.baseurl_root}}/assets/post_files/history/from-zencash-to-horizen/rocket.svg" alt="ZenCash to Horizen" style="">
</div>

**It started almost by accident**. **Rob Viglione**, the _co-founder_ of **Horizen**, was finishing his **Ph.D**. at the **University of South Carolina**, teaching a blockchain course, and working at **ZClassic** as a part-time hobby. ZClassic had a really informal team, but Rob was passionate about this project. He gradually increased his commitment and activity in the community and took on a leadership role as the project developed.

Rob met **Rolf Versluis** while working collaboratively on ZClassic. They both loved the ZClassic project, but they had a vision for what the future of _privacy_, _governance_, and _economics_ could look like. They learned of one another's shared visions through working together on the project. So they decided to meet one day. Rob invited Rolf, who lived in **Georgia**, to give a lecture to his university students and to sit down to discuss the prospects of their collaboration.

**ZClassic was a community project.** While Rob and Rolf had good ideas, they did not have the mandate to expand the scope of the ZClassic project fundamentally. Rob and Rolf decided to **fork ZClassic** into their own project due to these limitations. _They chose ZClassic because they were both believers in everyone's right to privacy_. Rob's love of **zero knowledge cryptography** and their combined passion for privacy promised to be an enormous leap towards true privacy in the cryptocurrency world.

Rob and Rolf forked ZClassic and co-founded **ZenCash**. They were finally able to begin pursuing their goals. They began implementing their ideas for _governance_, _economics_, _treasury_, and _privacy_ on a network level. On **May 19, 2017**, at the block height of **110000** of the ZClassic blockchain, they took the snapshot needed to enter the final phase of their launch. **ZenCash blockchain** was born on **May 30, 2017, 23:46:46 UTC**.

> On the more technical side, this is the block **#110000** that Rob and Rolf forked from. **ZenCash** began their new blockchain with a treasury model on block **#110001**. Note the **1.0625** ZEN emission in the coinbase transaction, which is the part of new coin emission that went to the treasury.

### From a Part-time Hobby to a Full-Time Job

Rob intended ZenCash to be a part-time job. He couldn't have known what would happen. A week after the official launch of ZenCash a former lead developer announced a **zero-day attack**. The developer shared a method of attacking the Zen blockchain publicly. This attack could lead to a transaction replay from the ZClassic blockchain to the Zen blockchain.

The minds at ZenCash were quick to act. **Cronic**, the _Horizen Infrastructure Manager_, was instrumental in the success of our project. Cronic and the ZenCash developers designed and deployed a method that prevented zero-day attacks. The support from **Bittrex** and **Team Veritas** helped out during this period. Rob and Rolf provided two updates daily to the community while the transaction replays were happening until the problem was solved.

**Over time, all users who lost funds from the replays were repaid from Community Funds**. Rob realized that working part-time wouldn't be enough. He gave up on finishing his Ph.D. and began working on the project full-time. They deployed the preventative measure on **June 12, 2017**, at block height **117000**. Paving the way for the future successes of the project.

During these early days, **Rosario** and others took their leading roles to help the community and first partnerships began to form. ZenCash engaged **Tatiana Moroz** and **Crypto Media Hub** for marketing.

### The Supper of Lisbon

**The initial Horizen team was not selected**. It emerged from volunteers who displayed commitment and passion for the project.

Community developers were important during **2017**. They added important tools, like **Insight API** by **anarch3**, **NodeJS ZenChat** and **Zen Android wallet** by **Kendricktan**, **Arizen wallet** by **Lukas**, and **Swing Wallet** by **Vaklinov**. They were also able to identify and fix issues with the _mining pool software_ thanks to **Hellcatz**.

**January 2018** marks an important date for ZenCash, now **Horizen**. The leadership team formalized for the first time during the **IOHK** conference in **Lisbon, Portugal**. **Rob**, **Rosario**, **Rowan** (Director of Business Development), **Gustavo** (User Experience Director) and **Alberto** (Director of R&D) gathered in the **Airbnb** they rented as a temporary office. They discussed and evaluated the performance of the volunteers who received stipends. They selected the most active and highest performing volunteers and offered them positions within the team. They officially welcomed several new members to the **Zen Blockchain Foundation** that month.

### Sustainable Funding Model

Volunteers will contribute if a project is interesting but you don't always attract professionals. Rob and Rolf learned this during their work at ZClassic. They did not have the funds to offer salaries because ZenCash did not offer a **premine** or an **ICO**. So the co-founders of ZenCash added an economic model into the project's protocol. **The model diverted part of the newly generated coins to the treasury fund allowing ZenCash to pay salaries, attract talent, and finance the project**.

### Incentives for Nodes and Other Stakeholders

As the economic model was implemented into the protocol, the team was able to begin offering incentives. They determined that part of the newly generated coins would go to the **Secure Node** operators who operated _full nodes_ on the ZEN blockchain. These operators used powerful hardware, a _dedicated IP address_, and a _TLS certificate_ to encrypt communications.

The incentive for doing this was **3.5%** of the block reward in the beginning but increased to **10%** with the introduction of **Super Nodes**. Our decision to incentivize node operators has resulted in **Horizen** having the largest full node network in the industry. The project has over **42,000 Secure Nodes** and over **4,300 Super Nodes** across the globe.

We are moving in the right direction as a project, **but we are not done**. We have dedicated ourselves to continuously identifying stakeholders who deserve incentive. **For example,** the contributors to the **ZenDAO system** will receive an incentive for participating in the _voting process_.

### Cooperation with IOHK, Code Particle, InfoPulse

Cooperation with **IOHK** began with a personal friendship with **Charles Hoskinson** (Strategic Adviser of **Horizen**) and a shared belief in personal freedom and privacy. Charles read the **ZenCash whitepaper** and reached out to Rob. They met in **New York City** to discuss the **Horizen Project** and **IOHK**. They also planned for a collaboration between the projects. The collaboration resulted in great contributions and a lot of complementary R&D between Horizen and IOHK.

**Horizen and IOHK have created many wonderful projects together.** The collaboration resulted in our scaling research (**BlockDAG**), **Dandelion++** (a network anonymity protocol), and the **Horizen Sidechains**.

One of the biggest projects that Horizen is working on with IOHK is the **treasury voting system**. IOHK brought the project to Horizen. Together we built upon and improved it, adding **zero knowledge cryptography** for secret ballot voting and more.

We have met many of our partners through Charles. He introduced us to **InfoPulse**, who helped us with the **Ledger**, **Trezor**, and **OpenBazaar** integrations coding and they are developing the **Horizen sidechains SDK**.

**Code Particle** is another noteworthy partner who works on development for the flagship app, **Sphere by Horizen**. They also provide core developer support for the **Horizen zend** - our core protocol software. **Pier Stabilini** (A lead engineer for **Code Particle**) works closely with our team and has contributed considerably to the project's success.

### The 51% Attack and a Solution to It

**Although the 51% attack was a great shock for the Horizen team** and community it did not come out of the blue. The whole industry was aware of a blog that stated the cost of 51% attacks against many projects. The Horizen team began disaster planning and brainstorming shortly after learning the cost to attack was low. We set up a **tripwire system** as part of the plan that would alert us if it detected a significant net-hash increase, and we put our tech team on a standby monitoring the network.

The **Zen** network was the target of a **51%** attack on **June 3, 2018**, at approximately **00:26 UTC** between blocks **318165** and **318275**. The attacker(s) caused multiple reorganizations of the blockchain, reverting **38** blocks in the longest reorganization. The attack successfully created three double spend transactions of **3317.4**, **6,600**, and **13,234.9** ZEN.

**The Horizen team** knew about it immediately thanks to the tripwire system. The team began executing the mitigation procedures they had been working on to significantly increase the difficulty of future attacks. Because our engineering team was already working on possible solutions for 51% attack, we did the **POC** and coding quickly and proceeded with the network upgrade.

We determined the best solution was to enhance the _longest chain rule_ (**Nakamoto Consensus**) and introduce a penalty for delayed block reporting. This makes it exponentially more difficult and costly for those looking to perform a 51% attack. You can read our [Solution to 51% Attacks](https://www.horizen.io/assets/files/A-Penalty-System-for-Delayed-Block-Submission-by-Horizen.pdf) whitepaper.

### Brand Expansion - from ZenCash to Horizen

**As our project grew bigger and more popular we were getting confused with ZCash more often**. It started making more sense for us to rebrand. Our project focused on product offerings like a _treasury voting system_ and _sidechains_ with **smart contracting** capability. We were more than our currency. The word "cash" in our name didn't describe what our project had started to become.

**The last push we needed to kick start our brand expansion** came in the form of a letter from a large international bank. In the letter, they expressed that the **ZenCash logo** was similar to their sister organization one, and they requested we change ours. It didn't make sense to fight over a branding that didn't fit us anymore.

So, we created a special task force and partnered with **BrandTuitive**. Our teams combined and spent hours upon hours working on our brand expansion. The result was, and still is, phenomenal. The name **Horizen** aligned perfectly with the mission and goals of our project. The team and our community loved that we were able to keep **ZEN** as part of our name. Since ZEN remained a part of us we were also able to maintain our **cryptocurrency's ticker symbol**, ZEN.
