            ZenChat is the first application aside from our cryptocurrency, ZEN, that is running on top of the Horizen Blockchain. It allows you to exchange messages with state of the art security via our flagship app, Sphere by Horizen.

To start a chat, you only have to exchange a conversation key with the person you want to message. Your conversation key is basically your contact on the blockchain. As soon as you have exchanged the conversation key you can start messaging each other with the highest level of privacy possible. Users are able to communicate 1-on-1 or through group messages.

In order to reduce spam, each message needs to have a small transaction fee attached, so you need some ZEN to start using ZenChat. The transaction fee is 0.0001 ZEN, in other words, 10,000 messages per ZEN. This is sufficiently low for regular users to not spend a lot of money on communication but sufficiently high to prevent spam across the network.

Go ahead and try it out for yourself! Here you can find the download of [Sphere by Horizen](https://www.horizen.global/spherebyhorizen/). After the setup procedure, make sure to go to Settings and enable the full mode. If you don't have any ZEN already, you can visit our [Faucet](https://getzen.cash/) and get a small amount of free ZEN for testing purposes. You don't need to register with us in order to use our Faucet. All you need to do is provide an address and complete a captcha.
