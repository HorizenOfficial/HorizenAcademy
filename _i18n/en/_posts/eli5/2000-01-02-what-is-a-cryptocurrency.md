            A cryptocurrency is digital money. There are many cryptocurrencies, just like there are many currencies like the dollar, the euro, and the ruble.

Each cryptocurrency runs on its own blockchain, because every currency needs its own record of transactions. Imagine I had one dollar and one euro, and I spend my dollar. The dollar blockchain records this transaction, identifies the new owner, and that I don't have that dollar anymore. On the other hand, this transaction does not affect the blockchain for all the euros.

If you own one ZEN, this means there is a transaction recorded on the blockchain where you received one ZEN, or several transactions that show you received a total of one ZEN.
