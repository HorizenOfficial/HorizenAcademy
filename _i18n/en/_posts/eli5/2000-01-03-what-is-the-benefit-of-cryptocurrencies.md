When you send money to an online shop or a friend, you are asking the bank to send the money on your behalf. What if the bank isn't open, like on a Sunday, or refuses to send the money for some reason?

            Cryptocurrencies are digital cash. You are in control of it and can give it to anyone, at any point. It doesn't matter if the other person is standing next to you or on the other side of the world; the transfer will take the same amount of time to complete. There are no opening hours and there is no one who can stop you from using your money the way you see fit.

            Another benefit is that you can choose if you want to do a transaction privately or publicly. Sometimes you don't want anyone to know what you are spending money on. With cryptocurrencies, you have the option to shield the transaction from the public.

            The greatest benefit might be that everyone can use cryptocurrencies. You only need an app to do so. Many people in less-developed countries don't have a bank account, and cannot send or receive money. With crypto, all they need is an app on their internet-connected smartphone and they can start transferring money the way most people do already.
