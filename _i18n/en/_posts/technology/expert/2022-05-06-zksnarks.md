ZKCP is a transaction protocol that allows a buyer to purchase information from a seller using Bitcoin in a manner which is private, scalable, secure, and which doesn’t require trusting anyone: the expected information is transferred if and only if the payment is made. The buyer and seller do not need to trust each other or depend on arbitration by a third party.\\

Imagine a movie-style “briefcase swap” (one party with a briefcase full of cash, another containing secret documents), but without the potential scenario of one of the cases being filled with shredded newspaper and the resulting exciting chase scene.

From: \url{https://z.cash/blog/zcash-private-transactions/}\\

Start from scratch (almost):\\

notation: zcash uses sk and PK for scalar and Vector. make it consistent with ECC shit\\

consider a particular node with a correct list of UTXOs (the ledger)\\

each utxo is an unspent "note", described by address/pk of its owner and amount in satoshi.\\

\begin{align*}
\text{Note}_i = (PK_i, \text{amount}_i)
\end{align*}

for simplicity: assume only notes/UTXO's worth 1 Bitcoin and 1 UTXO per address. this way we don't have to worry about amounts. database now looks like this\\

\begin{align*}
\text{Note}_1 = (PK_1), \text{Note}_2 = (PK_2), \text{Note}_3 = (PK_3)
\end{align*}

Alice 1, Bob 4. If Alice wants to transfer funds she sends message "Move funds (amount) from PK$_1$ to PK$_4$". message signed with $sk_1$ corresponding to $PK_1$. Node checks signature and amount and updates database. (only unspent ones displayed)

\begin{align*}
\text{Note}_2 = (PK_2), \text{Note}_3 = (PK_3), \text{Note}_4 = (PK_4)
\end{align*}

each note also contains a random "serial number"/ *unique identifier* $r$

\begin{align*}
\text{Note}_1 = (PK_1, r_1), \text{Note}_2 = (PK_2, r_2), \text{Note}_3 = (PK_3, r_3)
\end{align*}

Instead of storing notes in in plaintext, we can use hashes to store them in an encrypted fashion.

\begin{align*}
H_i = hash( \text{Note}_i) = hash(PK_i, r_i)
\end{align*}

blockchain immutable, actually all notes are stored, not just unspent ones.\\

how to determine which notes are spent and which ones are unspent? \textit{nullifier set} used for that.\\

The \textit{nullifier set} is the set of hashed *unique identifiers* $r_i$ of already spent notes (Note$_i$).\\

If we consider our example from above where Alice spent Note$_1$ the \textit{nullifier set} now comprises one element: $nf_1 = hash(r_1)$. The process of spending her note goes like this:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A random serial number $r_4$ is chosen by Alice, which defines a new note $\text{Note}_4 = (PK_4, r_4)$
\item $\text{Note}_4$ is privately send to Bob.
\item The nullifier of $\text{Note}_1$, $nf_1 = hash(r_1)$ is broadcast to all nodes. This defines the input to the transaction.
\item The hash of the new note, $H_4 = hash( \text{Note}_4)$, is broadcast to all nodes. This defines the output of the transaction.
\end{enumerate}

A node on the network would now store the following data:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Hashed notes & Nullifier Set\\
\hline
$H_1 = hash( \text{Note}_1)$ & $nf_1 = hash(r_1)$ \\
$H_2 = hash( \text{Note}_2)$ & \\
$H_3 = hash( \text{Note}_3)$ & \\
$H_4 = hash( \text{Note}_4)$ & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

A node on the network that receives the message $m = (nf_1, H_4)$ will check whether $nf_1$ is already part of the nullifier set. If it is not, than it adds $nf_1$ to its nullifier set and $H_4$ to its set of hashed notes. \textbf{This doesn't seem to add up. You can't compute $nf_1$ from $H_1$. You could make up some value and it won't be in the nullifier set (collision resistance)}\\

At this point we neither checked if Alice is the rightful owner, nor if the note corresponding to $nf_1$ existed in the first place.\\

With the tools we have thus far we could only solve this if Alice were to publish the unencrypted Note$_1$, but this would undermine the privacy property.\\

Quick recap: the tools we have used thus far. We started of with the **UTXO model**, where UTXOs are now called notes. We assumed knowledge of **ECC**, more precisely the relation between **public and private keys** and **digital signatures**. We used a **hash function** to encrypt notes.\\

New tool in the Box: Zero-Knowledge proofs\\

Alice will publish an additional piece of information when broadcasting her transaction to Bob, namely a *proof-string* $\pi$. This *proof-string* convinces all verifying nodes that whomever send this transaction has knowledge of $PK_1, sk_1,$ and  $r_1$.







\newpage
Intro, address types\\

UTXO called \textit{note} denoted $n$\\

Sapling note is a tuple ($d, pk_d, v, rcm$):

\begin{itemize}
\item $d$ is the \textit{diversifier} of the recipients shielded address
\item $pk_d$ diversified transmission key
\item $v$ is the value in zatoshi
\item $rcm$ is the random \textit{commitment trapdoor}
\end{itemize}

Shielded tx: note is send with \textit{commitment} instead of sig. Commitment is public and added to \textit{note commitment tree} data structure. "This allows the value and recipient to be kept private, while the commitment is used by the zero-knowledge proof when the note is spent, to check that it exists on the blockchain." - zcash spec\\



T-Addresses interact with the *Transparent Value Pool* or TVP. TVP contains publicly available TX data that can be viewed on the blockchain through the explorer. The verification process of these transparent transactions is analogous to the one in Bitcoin and based on **digital signatures**.\\

Shielded addresses encrypt TX data and and require a proof, namely a zero Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge or zkSNARK, to verify a transaction.

\subsubsection{4 Types (T-Z) Combinations - Properties (short)}

\begin{itemize}
\item T-T: A public TX
\item T-Z: A shielding TX
\item Z-Z: A private TX
\item Z-T: A deshielding TX
\end{itemize}

TX fee always visible\\

to Z address -> additional "memo field" in TX\\

reuse of z add. not problematic, all tx between them look identical. "However if two parties collude to compare a shielded payment address they can trivially determine they are the same."\\
