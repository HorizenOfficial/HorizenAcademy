Digital money would be useless if there was no way to transfer it. Fortunately, there is not just one way to transfer cryptocurrencies but many more advanced techniques that allow a transfer of value with different properties. In order to understand those other transaction mechanisms we examine the two most common accounting techniques used in blockchains: the UTXO and account model. Afterward, we look at two special types of transactions: using cross-chain transactions between different interoperable blockchains and state- and payment channels to transact almost entirely off-chain.

            In order to have users transfer money, they need some concept of an "account balance" in the first place. We compare two different accounting methods in the first article of this chapter.

            The second article in this chapter explains Cross-Chain Transactions. There are different ways to make blockchains interoperable. The Horizen protocol allows the deployment of sidechains, independent domain-specific blockchains that can interact with the Horizen mainchain. In order to transfer assets from the mainchain to one of the sidechains and back, a special type of transaction is introduced - the cross-chain transaction.

            Blockchains are very secure, but not very efficient or fast. In order to facilitate widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies as a payment method, different scaling solutions are being worked on. A very promising approach is posed by second-layer solutions using a technology called state- and payment channels. We take a look at how this technolopgy works in our last article of this chapter
