chapter: "How Does a Blockchain Work?"
---

You do know what a blockchain is by now, and we are sure you have a good idea of how it works if you made it this far. In this chapter we will take a detailed look at each concept that makes a blockchain work individually. It's worth noting that Bitcoin and thus blockchain as we know it is  more than ten years old by now, but most concepts described in this chapter preceded blockchains by years or even decades. The clever combination of these parts in a formerly (pre-Bitcoin) unknown way enabled something truly impressive though.

This chapter is by far the most extensive chapter in our Expert Section, but for the ambitious audience we didn't spare much detail.

            Next we look at public-key cryptography, the concept that allows digital scarcity and ownership of data to exist. We have split this important article up in three parts: Elliptic Curve Cryptography, a specifc PKC scheme, the process of deriving an address from a private key and lastly, digital signatures.

            One of the great innovations introduced with blockchain was solving the Byzantine Generals Problem: coming to consensus in a setting with many unknown and untrustworthy actors. Consensus mechanisms allow blockchains to achieve just that. In this subchapter we explain consensus in distributed systems, Proof of Work and other consensus mechanisms.
