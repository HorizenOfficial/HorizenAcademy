HTLCs are a construction used within the lightning network.\\


**TODO: Update -> little explanation for each box**

![Channel Hierarchy](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/4.2-state-payment-channels/channel_hierarchy_D.jpg)

special type of channel contract that gives us some special properties.\\

Precursor: \textit{Hash-locked Transaction}. $H$ is a fixed hash function. Alice wants to send Bob 1 coin via intermediary Ingrid.\\

Bob picks a random value $x$ and sends its hash $h = H(x)$ to Alice, who creates a \textit{Hash-locked Transaction} ($HLT_A$). That TX sends 1 Coin to intermediary Ingrid if she reveals preimage $x$. Ingrid creates $HLT_B$ with Bob, so that when Bob reveals preimage of $h$ he gets coin. Now Bob reveals $x$ to ingrid and gets his coin. Ingrid can use $x$ to unlock already created $HLT_A$ and get a "refund" of 1 Coin. Payment complete.\\

Knowledge of preimage $R$ corresponding to hash $H$ releases funds. main concept.\\

HTLCs Allows multi-hop channel. Time lock needed for unresponsive cases. In general 2 different kind of time-locks: relative and absolute time-locks\\

nLockTime used to define time lock. Mostly for cases where counterparty becomes unreactive.\\

to ensure everybody has time to redeem funds -> decrementing timelocks.\\

"The Sprites project [6] observed that this mechanism implies deadlines must be staggered, which implies worst-case capital lockup time grows linearly in the number of hops and hence a total capital lockup cost that grows quadratically in the number of hops. They designed an alternative solution where hash revelation deadline is set to be earlier than the dispute resolution deadline, allowing all locks to have the same deadline. Hence, capital lockup time is independent of the number of hops, and total capital lockup cost is linear in the number of hops." - counterfactual\\

"Similar to RSMCs, these contract terms are programatically enforced on the Bitoin blockchain and do not require trust in the counterparty to adhere to the contract terms, as all violations are penalized via unilaterally enforced fidelity bonds, which are constructed using penalty transactions spending from commitment states."\\

An HTLC is an additional output in a Commitment Transaction with a unique output script\\

after three days both transactions may be valid, depending on which is broadcast first.\\

"With uncooperative counterparties itâ€™s not possible to terminate an HTLC without broadcasting it to the bitcoin blockchain as the uncooperative party is unwilling to create a new Commitment Transaction." lightning\\

"To be able to terminate this contract off-chain without a broadcast to the Bitcoin blockchain requires embedding RSMCs in the output, which will have a similar construction to the bidirectional channel."\\

\subsubsection{Most promising Use Case - Atomic Swaps}

in Zcash: Atomic Cross-Chain Transactions (XCAT)\\

Comit paper!\\

"Payment can be routed by participants in both chains in the hop. E.g. Alice is on Bitcoin, Bob is on both Bitcoin and X-Coin and Carol is on a hypothetical X-Coin, Alice can pay Carol without understanding the X-Coin consensus rules."\\

"COMIT uses HTLCs and Payment Channels for cross-chain transactions. LPs place bids for asset exchange across channels and the COMIT Routing Protocol (CRP) selects the best path across multiple LPs to send the transaction to the recipient."\\

"A routing protocol that is private to Users, scalable in terms of network size and DOS-resistant for Liquidity Providers is an important factor."\\

Routing based on BOLT \#4 Onion Routing Protocol from Lightning extended to multi-asset used in Comit \url{https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md}\\

"Each User in the network learns about available LPs via a gossip protocol and constructs the route for each of his transactions transaction route, by using the public key of each intermediate LP as well as the final recipient Business or User." comit\\

\subsubsection{Free option problem}:

Alice locks up 1 BTC in an HTLC (48 h) while Bob locks 100 LTC in corresponding 24 h HTLC. Alice can now watch prices. If prices change in her favor, she can execute trade. If prices change in Bobs favor, she can let the contract run out. She basically bought an american style call-option where she has the right to complete the trade or not based on price movement. This usually comes with a premium that she is most likely not paying in most HTLC setups.

\subsubsection{Attack/Problem or Liquidity DOS}:

A malicious actor can specifically route a payment through a large number of hops. He can then hold on to his preimage and not complete the HTLC, thereby locking the funds of many people for a period of time (e.g. 24 hours). The participants in between won't even receive a fee for routing his payment, as the HTLC won't be completed.

This would allow an attacker to slow down or halt a payment channel network by locking up most of the liquidity on the network with a small amount of capital, that is not even lost, but only locked up for this time period.


\textbf{Complexity}:

Embedding HTLCs in payment channels is non-trivial. It imposes many requirements on the base ledger such as common hash functions, timelocks, and smart contracting capabilities.


\subsubsection{Possible alternative: Packetized Payments}

Small part of the Interledger Protocol, created by Ripple!?!

Same situation: Bob and Alice want to exchange 1 BTC vs 100 LTC. Nobody wants to send entire payment first. Idea: send fraction first, depending on risk appetite this could be 0.0001 BTC. Now they sequentially exchange small amounts, taking turns until trade is completed. If counterparty cheats at any point, the channel can be closed. Very little risk, can set up the single transactions down to 1 sat. Solution works for multi-hop payments as well.

Packetized Payments address the free option problem as well as the griefing risk.

Not more expensive to deposit funds in payment channel than it is to deposit them in HTLC (on-chain channel funding TX)
