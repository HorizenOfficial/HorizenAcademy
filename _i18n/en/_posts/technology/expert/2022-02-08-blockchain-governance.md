Bitcoin Governance: https://medium.com/@pierre_rochard/bitcoin-governance-37e86299470f



One of the most highly valued properties of public blockchain protocols are their level of decentralization. Usually there is a lot of focus on how decentralized the block generation process is but little on how code and other changes are decided upon. Governance is the keyword here.

While there is no deterministic way of assigning a "decentralization score" to a given project (yet), some projects certainly seem to be goverened by a larger and more diverse group of people than others and you might consider these more decentralized. This doesn't mean that there have been no attempts at quantifying decentralization, introducing metrics such as the [*minimum Nakamoto coefficient*](https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e) based on the ideas of the *Gini Coefficient* and *Lorenz Curves*. It is determined by assigning a decentralization score to the different subsystems of a blockchain (mining, clients, developers, exchanges, nodes and wallet distribution) and aggregating those scores into an overall score.

> *"Governance fundamentally consists of three questions: What should we do, who gets to decide, and how are the deciders chosen and held accountable?"* - Sonya Mann, [The new ZIP Process and Zcash Governance](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/new-zip-process/)

In order to address these question practically, they have to be approached in reverse order. First you need to determine how to choose the deciders, then choose them and lastly, have them make decisions. This makes it sound rather straight forward and in reality things are a little more complex.
In this article, we want to give an overview of what types of mechanisms there are to make the decisions mentioned above and explain how we at Horizen think about governance.

### Choosing the Deciders

In a perfect world every stake holder has a say when it comes to how the deciders of a project are chosen and ideally there would be some sort of "fair" vote on it - whatever fair means in this context.

Realistically, there cannot always be a process in place for how to choose the deciders. Most projects in the blockchain space start with a few like-minded people having an idea for what their ideal cryptocurrency, dApp or blockchain platform should look like. Often times they find each other in a project similar to what they want to build.

All of these projects started working on making their idea become a reality at some point. The group of people that has formed around an idea will than gravitate towards a focal point for the development of the project. Often times this is a GitHub repository or organization.

At the time people start putting actual work into the realization of the project idea, individuals will start to build a reputation - good or bad - and this is the organic way of how deciders emerge from the group. People that put in more time, more work and have better ideas will naturally be recognized as the thought leaders of the project. They will usually take on leading roles in the development process, becoming repository maintainers and administrators.

Once a public open-source project gains momentum and people outside the initial group start to become aware, some of them will consequently get involved. By supporting a given project an individual is (conciously or not) signalling her support for the direction of the project and the approach the project has taken on governace thus far.

Some projects have a process in place to determine for deciding who gets to have a say in governance decision. When delegated governance is used, a fixed number of validators or block producers is chosen. These entities not only take care of maintaining the blockchain, but also have influence on decisions around the code, especially its consensus critical parts.

### The Decision Makers

In the early stages of open-source projects those who emerged from the founding stage with the best reputation and largest social capital will get to make decisions. At this time those decisions are usually not very critical as the network has not accrued much real-world value, which is not to say that decision made at the early stages of a blockchain project cannot have far reaching consequences later on. The people with the necessary backing to make decisions on behalf of the project can, at their discretion, introduce governance processes. Improvement proposal processes are one example we will look at more closely later in this article.

But what does decide mean anyways? What types of decisions typically have to be made in a blockchain project?
There is a wide range of decision with varying degrees of consequnces. Some design decisions that are made in the very beginning determine parameters like the target block time, the block size and similar metrics.

An important design decision for a blockchain project is the choice of the [consensus mechanism](), and in case of [Proof of Work]() blockchains, the [mining algorithm](). These types of decisions effect the economies of the project, as well as the ecosystem around the protocol. When there is mining, existing miners with specialized hardware for a wide-spread mining algorithm can be targeted or the project can try to avoid ASICs being used and choose an algorithms better suited to be mined with general purpose hardware.

Most blockchain projects are fundamentally based on Bitcoins code and Horizen is no exception. After the code is forked it is modified according to the design decisions that were previously made. Extending the core client with usefull libraries or APIs will increase the attractiveness for developers and therefore in the long run also for users, as those usually benefit from more developer activity. How to extend and enhance the code of the initial release will mostly be decided upon by those with social capital in the community around the project.

If a project is build from scratch there are some additional decisions to be made. What language the blockchain client or deamon is written in influences what type of developers the project will attract.

The types of decisions above mostly effect new and emerging projects, but what about those that have been live for a while and that already have an ecosystem around them? Discussing all types of decisions would blow the scope of this article, but over the last couple of years one type of decision has proven to challenge the decision makers of all blockchain projects alike: how do we scale?

The best examples of this decision type are most likely the [block size limit controversy](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy) in Bitcoin from 2015-2017 as well as the scalibility discussions in and around [Eth2.0](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs).

As we said earlier it is hard to create a "decentralization score" for a public blockchain, but can we come up with a desirable level of decentralization that we deem necessary for any network?
This is a tough question and the short answer is probably no. Depending on the use case different levels of decentralization are required. For a network mainly providing verifiable scarcity of in-game artefacts decentralization is arguably less important than a protocol providing a global Store of Value (SoV).

The robustness of a system is proportional to its points of control. A single point of control leads to a single point of failure and low robustness, whereas many distributed points of low influence lead to more robust systems. On the other hand, less points of control lead to faster decision making and greater adaptability to external stimuli. As I said above: depending on the use-case either one of those properties can be more desirable and you cannot deem one better or worse than the other without considering the purpose of the project.

Below, we will look at three different categories of governance systems that range from company like structures in the delegated governance model to the democracy inspired approach of a DAO.

#### Delegated Governance

In a delegated governance the idea is to have users vote on a fixed number of block producers. To give you an idea, some of the larger projects around that use a delegated governance approach have between 21 and 50 delegates. On paper, delegated governance looks similar to representative democracies where the users cast votes for their representatives, which in turn make decisions on their behalf. They differ, in that the blockchain equivalent usually has no fixed terms and more importantly, non of the processes around chosing the delegates are legally binding.

Effectively, projects using delegated governance models often resemble corporate structures rather than community driven open-source projects. The small number of delegates allows for an efficient collaboration of delegates, if this is for the better or worse is up to anyone to decide. As we said earlier, good or bad are not the right categories here. Most delegated governance systems prefer performance over robustness and that is a legitimate choice. In the end users vote with their feet if these systems provide value to them or not.

#### Decentralized Governance

Before we talk about decentralized governance we should take a stab at defining criteria for what decentralization means. As mentioned above, this won't yield a deterministic "decentralization score" but rather a **common language and a framework we can use to discuss decentralization.**

> *"Schneider[2013], responding to conceptual confusion in academia over political decentralization, finds that decentralization is political, administrative, and fiscal. Within the Bitcoin network, decisionmaking structures (chiefly orchestrated by Core developers) can be understood as political, nodes enforcing rulesets can be understood as administrators, and fiscal power is wielded by miners."* - Nic Carter, [A Cross-Sectional Overview of Cryptoasset Governance and Implications for Investors](https://coinmetrics.io/papers/dissertation.pdf)

This very interesting view was taken from Nic Carters dissertation on blockchain governance. It confirms our thesis, that decentralization can be assessed on different levels of the project structure. 

Bitcoin is the prime example for decentralized governance as its ecosystem grew in the most organic way, had the most time to evolve and the least attention at launch. The Schelling point for Bitcoin development is the [Bitcoin Core GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin). If we adhere to the classification suggested by Schneider, this makes the GitHub repositories of a blockchain project the *political* focal point.

Repository maintainers have to sign every merge commit with their PGP keys. Only merge commits signed by one of the trusted maintainer keys are able to be merged. This prevents people with extended access to the repository, such as GitHub employees, to insert malicious code without being noticed.

> "Rather than base the integrity of the code off of GitHub accounts, Bitcoin Core has a continuous integration system that performs checks of trusted PGP keys that must sign every merge commit." - Jameson Lopp, [Who Controls Bitcoin Core](https://blog.lopp.net/who-controls-bitcoin-core-/)

While this process does not make the security system unfailable - PGP keys can be stolen, the securtiy is certainly enhanced.
Another principle used to increase the security of the "political process" is the *principle of least priviledge*, an important concept in computer security. It describes the practice of limiting each users acccess rights to the very minimum that is required for them to do their work.

Bitcoin does not have a *formal specification* as nobody has the authority to define what the system should do. Formal specifications are used to describe a system, to analyze its behavior, and to aid in its design by verifying key properties of interest. If one had to find the closest thing to a formal specification for Bitcoin, it would be the code of the Bitcoin Core repository.

There are two types of voting mechanisms that have been used in the Bitcoin ecosystem thus far. The first and by now deprecated mechanisms used the *version* field in Bitcoin blocks, introduced with [BIP-0034](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki). It was used three times to upgrade the system from version 1 to version 4. The function behind it is called *IsSuperMajority()* or *ISM* for short. Miners used the version data field to signal readiness for backward compatible code changes (soft forks). Once 950 out of the most recent 1000 blocks signaled acceptance for proposed changes by incrementing the version number the changes were activated. Going forward all blocks having a lower version number would be orphaned.

An updated process was implemented using *version bits*, described in [BIP-0009](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki). Version bits extends the idea of the version data field. The data field in the version bit system is interpreted as a bit vector instead of a simple integer. Each bit in it's bitwise representation signals the accepance (or lack thereof) of a soft fork. This allows up to 29 soft forks to be proposed concurrently.

If we were to apply Schneiders logic to this process, this would mean that "political" suggestions from developers are decided upon by the "fiscal power" of miners. Once a decision is made, the nodes on the network enforce the new rules in their role as the "administrators". Ascribing miners the role of wielding the "fiscal power" feels like an inaccurate comparison in this specific context. Generally speaking, it can be very hard to apply terminology from existing governance processes to blockchain projects. They operate very differently from most systems we know, and hence it might be necessary to come up with new processes to govern these systems and new terminology to describe the governance processes.

Next, we look at an innovative and experimental governance approach that is enabled by the birth of blockchain technology: the DAO.

#### DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization

The DAO or *decentralized autonomous organization* is an organization governed by rules written in code. It acts truly predictable according to a predefined "constitution" and is controlled by its shareholders. Shareholders have the power to change the rules of the DAO, but only if making changes to them was enabled at the DAO's inception. Rules might just as well be hardcoded, without the option to adapt them later on.

Interactions with a DAO are tracked with timestamps and [digital signatures]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-04-3-digital-signatures %}) recorded on-chain. The general concept was introduced as a *decentralized autonomous corporation* (DAC) in [an article](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/is-bitcoin-overpaying-for-false-security) by Dan Larimer in 2013. Vitalik Buterin went one step further and proposed that human management could be made obsolete if the smart contracts governing the DAO were written in a turing complete language.

Building a DAO is no simple endeavour. The code governing a DAO is public and anyone interested can review the code and find potential vulnerabilities. Fixing the code is difficult though, as any decision related to rule changes is subject to building consensus around it first.

The most notable attempt at creating a decentralized autonomous organization was [*The DAO*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)) on the Ethereum blockchain. It was launched with US$150 million of assets under control in 2016 as a venture capital fund and immediately got hacked. About US$50 million in cryptoassets were stolen by the hackers. The hack was reverted by reorganizing the Ethereum blockchain, which in turn led to a chain split. The Ethereum Classic chain is the Ethereum chain where the hack was not reverted, while investors on the Ethereum chain were refunded.

### Decision Making

Now that we have looked at different models of who gets to make decisions, we have to figure out what to do. There are different processes the "decision makers" can follow to decide, and one of the most widely used processes are improvement proposals. They come in different flavors and vary to some degree, but the general idea remains the same.

#### Improvement Proposal Processes

Improvement proposals processes are mainly a formalized way of suggesting changes and handling those suggestions from idea to activation. Many blockchain projects have developed their own flavor of this process. Bitcoin's BIPs, Ethereum's EIPs, Zcash's ZIPs, and Horizen's ZenIPs are among them. Aragon, a platform specifically built to providing organizations with blockchain based governance tool calls their version *Aragon Governance Proposals* or AGPs.

Following the improvement proposal process is usually no requirement for suggesting changes to the project, but especially for contributors without an existing track record of valuable contributions, following the *X*IP process will increase the chances of the proposal being at least considered. We will explain the ZenIP process in more detail later, to give you an idea of what such an improvement proposal process entails.

### Implementing Changes

Now, that we have answered our three initial questions of how deciders are chosen, who gets to decide, and what is done we need to look at how agreed upon changes can be implemented. The biggest consideration is if the changes can be implemented in a downward compatible upgrade, a *soft fork* or in a non-backward compatible upgrade, a *hard fork*.

#### Soft Forks

Soft forks are backward compatible upgrades to a blockchain, think a WhatsApp update. Just because your friends run the latest version you can run an older one and still be able to chat with them. A soft fork can be triggered either by the users or nodes - a *user activated soft fork* (UASF), or it can be triggered by miners in a *miner activated soft fork* (MASF).

**UASFs**

The most notable example of a user activated soft fork was the activation of *Segregated Witness* (SegWit) on the Bitcoin blockchain. SegWit fixes [*transaction malleability*](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_malleability) and increases the block capacity. It had long been discussed with a non-significant amount of opposition, especially from miners, before a contributor eventually forked the Bitcoin Core client, built the *Bitcoin UASF* client and made it publicly available.

The new client gained traction and created pressure on miners to adopt the changes. Miners need to produce valid blocks in order to be compensated for their efforts and by not upgrading to enable SegWit they would have risked to have their blocks rejected by the majority of nodes. After a certain date, the Bitcoin UASF client would have rejected blocks by miners that refused SegWit. This could have led to a contentious fork of the network. Miners considered the threat to the networks utility (and hence value) serious enough to follow the majority of nodes and activate SegWit eventually. An important learning at that time was that the miners influence on the network can be overruled by its users when there is strong consensus among them.

**MASFs**

In a miner activated soft fork the block producers signal their readiness for an update by including some metadata in a blocks header. [BIP-0034](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki) introduced this concept on the Bitcoin blockchain. The initial mechanism for MASFs had miners increment a blocks *version* number by one in order to support a soft fork. Once 95% of the most recent 1000 blocks would signal readiness to upgrade, all blocks with the previous version number would be rejected.

This initial mechanism was updated to use [*version bits*](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki) instead of the version number. By interpreting the individual bits of the *nVersion* data field in the block header as a bit vector, a single block header can signal acceptance or rejection for up to 29 forks at once. When a sufficiently large share of hash power has signalled readiness for a fork, full nodes will enforce those rule changes acccordingly.

#### Hard Forks

A hard fork is a downward incompatible upgrade to a blockchain, think a new Playstation. With your old console you won't be able to play the new games developed for Playstation 4. The two most notable hardforks in the blockchain space have been the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic hardfork that reverted the DAO  hack and the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash hardfork. Bcash increased the maximum block size. The Bitcoin client won't recognize these larger blocks as valid, hence it is backward incompatible. In case of the Ethereum hardfork the two versions didn't share a common transaction history anymore, hence the incompatibility.

### Horizen Governance

Now, that we have established an understanding of the most important concepts around blockchain governance let us take a look at the governance within the Horizen ecosystem.

#### ZenIP Process

It has been the stated goal of Horizen from the very beginning to build a decentralized platform, where not just the infrastructure is distributed, but also the funding and decision making.

The ZenIP process will be an important step towards a decentralized decision making process for the Horizen ecosystem. Similar processes have proven to work well for decentralized blockchain projects, hence it should be the best way to distribute influence and power towards the broader community of open source contributors and stakeholders.

ZenIPs are meant to standardize the process of suggesting major changes to the Horizen code base and processes. A ZenIP in and of itself is a document that describes a new feature. It explains the rationale behind the proposed feature and elaborates on why certain design decisions were made. Each ZenIP starts with an *Owner* proposing a new idea in the form of a ZenIP. After investigating if the idea is original and if it has chances of being accepted the idea is put in the form of a ZenIP.

The document needs to contain an abstract, a section about the motivation for the proposed change, a specification as well as a reference implementation. The draft is publicized by creating a pull request against the [ZenIP GitHub repository](https://github.com/ZencashOfficial/ZenIPs). 

![The ZenIP Workflow](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.7-governance/zenip_workflow.jpg)

*Editors* act as the repository maintainers and there are currently three of them, one representing the Zen Blockchain Foundation, another one representing the *Horizen Community Council* and one for *Horizen Labs*.
They merge the pull requests in draft status when they deem the document complete. Once there is rough consensus on the forums where the ZenIP in question is discussed and the document is complete the status can be changed from *Draft* to *Proposed* by a supermajority of editors.
Next, code-related ZenIPs change status from *Proposed* to *Implemented* once the Owner provides a reference implementation of their proposal.
A ZenIP becomes *Final* when its associated protocol change is activated on Horizen's mainnet.

A Process or Informational ZenIP may change status from Proposed to Active when it achieves rough consensus on the forum or pull request. Such a proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion for at least one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it.
We invite you to check out the [ZenIP repository](https://github.com/ZencashOfficial/ZenIPs) and get involved in the discussions around it and propose your ideas to the Horizen community.

#### The Horizen Treasury DAO

Horizen is dedicated to building a DAO as a [sidechain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /horizen/expert/2028-01-03-sidechains %}) application. It will enable decentralized, community based governance, especially with regards to resource allocation. Part of the Horizen block subsidy goes to the Zen Blockchain Foundation treasury (at the time of writing 20%), from where it gets distributed to fund the development of the protocol, the sidechain implementation, marketing as well as business development.
The basic model of the treasury system is described in [a paper][https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/zhangb2/treasury.pdf] written by our research and development partner, Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) in collaboration with the Lancaster University.

The general idea of the Horizen DAO is to have stakeholders in the Horizen ecosystem vote on what the treasury funds at the Zen Blockchain Foundations disposal are spent on. Anyone in the community can submit a proposal for consideration. Stakeholders can review the proposals that get passed on, and then they get sent to the next stage where ZEN holders can vote on where funding gets placed. There are many types of voting mechanisms and electoral systems in general to choose from when building such a system. The Horizen DAO will use a form of Liquid Democracy as the mechanism for voting. A thorough discussion of voting schemes would blow the scope of this article. Still, we would like to outline the core idea behind liquid democracy.

The two existing forms of democracy we know from traditional governance processes are *representative democracy* and *direct democracy*. The first forms of democracy were direct democracies. They offered their participants fairness, accountability, and control, but they donâ€™t scale well with an increasing number of participants. Most democracies evolved into representative democracies over time for this reason. While they allow a large number of voters to participate in the decision-making process there are issues with regards to the transparency of representativesâ€™ votes and decisions, the accountability of representatives, and high barriers to entry for participants wanting to get involved in the decision-making process.

![Liquid Democracy](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.7-governance/liquid_democracy_D.jpg)
![Liquid Democracy](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.7-governance/liquid_democracy_M.jpg)

Liquid Democracy can be understood as a dynamic hybrid of the two established branches of democracy, direct and representative. Liquid democracy combines many of the upsides of each while doing away with most of their weaknesses. With liquid democracy, you have the option of delegating your vote to an "expert" that represents your views without your delegation being tied to election terms of any kind. A key difference is that you can delegate your vote to whomever you like and you can withdraw your delegation at any given time - making the whole process very fluid - or *liquid*. This reduces the barrier to entry for people willing to get involved in the governance process and keeps delegates accountable because they can lose delegations at any time. Alternatively, you can decide to vote on any given issue yourself. A detailed summary of the IOHK paper can be found [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/about-a-treasury-system-for-cryptocurrencies-ecd9913fe0cc).

As we said earlier, DAOs are still experimental at this point in time. There are many unknowns around a DAOs legal status and how to best set it up, as there is little to no precedent of a DAO working for a sustained period of time. Nonetheless the concept is highly interesting from our perspective and promises big advancement in terms of [social scalability](https://hackernoon.com/social-scalability-the-most-important-idea-in-cryptocurrency-73d60e08b85a) if implemented correctly. Thus we consider it an effort worth making to build a DAO to govern the Zen Blockchain Foundation's finances.

### Summary

Open source protocol governance is something thatâ€™s constantly iterated and improved upon. The blockchain space is relatively young, and compared to  traditional governance processes so is open source software in general. The large number of different projects represent a huge real-worl sandbox environment. Many differents attempts at creating fair governance are being tried in parallel at this stage, and only experimentation and constant iteration will improve governance by making it more transparent, efficient and hopefully fairer.

> "In fact, the search of a perfect organizational structure for cryptocurrency governance, may not be that different from the search for the best ways for governing human societies." - Ken Alabs

The quote above might be the ultimate truth when it comes to governance. Arguably, such a process will never be perfect. Some stakeholders will always see room for improvement even when others are completely in line with the current process. It is difficult to determine what perfect means on paper, let alone implementing such a system.

Projects with different goals will also require different approaches to governance. While a global store of value such as Bitcoin needs a conservative approach to governance, moving carefully and slow, new projects working on cutting edge technological advances need faster decision making in order to realize their goals. The entire blockchain space is still young enough to be considered in a sandbox stage.

Hence, governance needs to be project specific, accounting for the goals and the existing community. Time will tell what the "best" approaches to governance in the open source arena are.
