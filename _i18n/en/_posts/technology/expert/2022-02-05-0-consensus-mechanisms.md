One of the great innovations introduced with blockchain was solving the Byzantine Generals Problem: coming to consensus in a setting with many unknown and potentially untrustworthy actors. Consensus mechanisms allow blockchains to achieve just that.
Because we want to take a detailed look at the two most researched ways of achieving consensus, we split this topic into two articles: 

<div class="row mt-5">
    <div class="col-md-3">

            <img src="/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.4.0-consensus/consensus.png" alt="Consensus in Distributed Systems" />
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
        <h5 class="intro-article-title">Consensus in Distributed Systems</h5>
        <p class="mb-1">
            In this first article, we look at consensus in distributed systems. What are the main challenges that arise when a system is operated by many unknown actors? And how does one ensure agreement on a common transaction history is reached?

        <h5 class="intro-article-title">Proof of Work</h5>
        <p class="mb-1">
            Proof-of-Work (PoW) was the first consensus mechanism that worked in a distributed environment of untrusted parties. Its principle is based on voting on a version of the history with the weight of your computing power.
