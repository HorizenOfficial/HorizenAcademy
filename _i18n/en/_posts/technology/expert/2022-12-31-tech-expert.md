            In this chapter, we talk about transactions on the blockchain. The basics of transaction have been covered in previous levels, so we look at more advanced concepts here. First, we compare the two most commonly used balance systems, the UTXO and account model. Second, we look at cross-chain transactions in Horizen transferring assets between main- and sidechain. Lastly, we talk about transactions using payment channel networks like Lightning.
