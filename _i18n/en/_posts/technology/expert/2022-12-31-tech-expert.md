            In the first chapter of the Expert Level, we talk about how blockchains store date and why this allows you to transfer value. We explain smart contracts and look at a close relative - the DAG.

            This second chapter of the Technology Expert section is the most extensive chapter. We start with an overview of the different elements of a blockchain, before we look into each element individually. We start with hash functions, continue with public-key cryptography and consensus mechanisms and finish with the P2P network, mining and blokchain governance.
