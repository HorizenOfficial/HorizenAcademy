            This second chapter of the Technology Expert section is the most extensive chapter. We start with an overview of the different elements of a blockchain, before we look into each element individually. We start with hash functions, continue with public-key cryptography and consensus mechanisms and finish with the P2P network, mining and blokchain governance.

            In the fourth chapter we talk about transactions on the blockchain. The basics of transaction have been covered in previous levels, so we look at more advanced concepts here. First, we compare the two most commonly used balance systems, the UTXO and account model. Second, we look at cross-chain transactions in Horizen transferring assets between main- and sidechain. Lastly, we talk about transactions using payment channel networks like Lightning.
