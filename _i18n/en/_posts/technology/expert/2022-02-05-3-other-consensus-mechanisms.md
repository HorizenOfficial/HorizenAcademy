A blockchain shows it's strength when out in the wild, living on a permissionless, distributed [peer-to-peer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-06-the-p2p-network %}) network. The biggest challenge when designing such a multi-agent system is achieving *consensus* among its participants.

> "All blockchains are fundamentally a deterministic state machine acted upon by transactions. Consensus is the process of agreeing on a deterministic order of transactions and filtering invalid transactions." - Dan Larimer

A global, digital money only works, if all participants agree on *who* owns *what* at any given time - they need to reach consensus. Once computations are performed on top of a blockchain via [*smart contracts*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-01-04-guaranteed-execution-with-smart-contracts %}), achieving consensus not just on what events happened, but also in which order the events happened becomes even more crucial.

In our last articles we looked at [consensus in distributed systems]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-05-1-consensus-in-distributed-systems %}) in general and afterward at Nakamoto Consensus and [Proof of Work]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-05-2-proof-of-work %}) (PoW) as the first mechanism to achieve Byzantine Fault-Tolerance in an asynchronous network.

Byzantine behavior technically refers to random behavior but is commonly used to describe malicious actors diverging from the protocol. An asynchronous environment means the protocol is run on a network, where there is no known bound to message delays. Messages can take an arbitrary time to reach their destination or can be dropped altogether.

The goal of a consensus mechanism is to achieve *liveness* and *safety* in this environment.

We defined liveness, as the property of all nodes eventually computing a new state based on some external input. Put differently, the system doesn’t stall. In the context of blockchains, liveness means that all transactions originating from an honest account will eventually end up in the blockchain of all other honest participants. This is closely related to the property of censorship resistance. Next we defined safety as all non-faulty nodes agreeing on new states - the blocks. Therefore, safety is closely related to the immutability property of blockchains.

Proof of Work uses a probabilistic leader election process to determine who gets to mine the next block. The probability of becoming the next leader is directly proportional to the relative computational power one is contributing to the network. PoW has the longest track record of working in an adversarial environment because it is used by Bitcoin, the oldest blockchain in existence.

An often cited criticism of PoW is its high energy consumption and while Bitcoins PoW seems to be [incentive compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive_compatibility) it comes with certain limitations regarding throughput. An increase in throughput of PoW blockchains can be achieved in various ways. Second layer technologies like [state and payment channels]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-04-03-state-payment-channels %}) move signed transactions off-chain and parallelization via [sidechains]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /horizen/expert/2028-01-03-sidechains %}) moves data to parallel, interoperable blockchains. [DAGs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-01-05-a-relative-the-dag %}) introduce an entirely new data structure to distributed ledgers and require modifications to the consensus mechanism.

![Scaling](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/1.4-dags/scaling_dag_D.jpg)

In this article, we will look at an additional option to increase the throughput of a distributed ledger - changing the consensus mechanism. Many *Proof of X* schemes have been proposed over the last decade that aim to improve upon PoW in several ways. We want to give you a comprehensive overview with a good amount of technical info in this article. We cannot do justice to every consensus mechanism, as this would fill an entire book in and off itself. But we do hope that after reading this article you will have a general orientation in the vast space of consensus research. The paper ["SoK: Consensus in the Age of Blockchains"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03936.pdf) will be interesting to those willing to depp dive into consensus mechanisms.

*Note*: We will focus on consensus mechanisms meant to work for permissionless systems here. A wide range of additional consensus mechanism exist, that can be used to reach consistency in distributed but permissioned databases such as those run by software giants like Google, Facebook or Amazon. Open systems such as public blockchains require a much more robust way to reach consistency and we exclusively consider those.

### PoS - Proof of Stake

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a type of consensus algorithm for distributed networks that depends on the economic stake a participant has in the network.

> "The main difference between consensus mechanisms is the way in which they delegate and reward the verification of transactions. (...) In one way or another, blockchain consensus algorithms boil down to some kind of vote where the number of votes that a user has is tied to the amount of a limited resource that is under the user’s control." - Demiro Massessi

In PoS the participants producing - or *forging* - new blocks are called validators. In their function, they are analogous to miners in PoW blockchains. The number of votes a participant has in PoS consensus is proportional to the number of coins the participant has *staked*. 

> "In PoS-based public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum's upcoming Casper implementation), a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator's vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake)." - [Ethereum Proof of Stake FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ)

Staking is a very loose term that comes in many different flavors. Today, the most common understanding of staking (in the PoS context) is placing funds in a type of escrow for the time a user wants to act as a validator. This allows for the implementation of penalties if a validator were to display malicious behavior. More on that later.
Validators are incentivized to produce blocks by collecting the transaction fees of all included transactions and depending on the protocol by a block subsidy.

The first Proof of Stake based protocol, [PPCoin](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/PPCoin%3A-Peer-to-Peer-Crypto-Currency-with-King-Nadal/0db38d32069f3341d34c35085dc009a85ba13c13), was proposed as an academic paper by Sunny King in 2012. This first iteration of the back-then new consensus algorithm considered all participants owning a stake in the protocol as potential validators. Locking up a stake was not necessary.
It didn't take long projects such as Peercoin, PIVX, and Reddcoin implemented a variant of PoS to achieve consensus on transaction validity and ordering.

A first differentiation between the many different implementations of PoS can be achieved by classifying them as either *chain-based PoS* or *Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant (BFT) PoS*. While in chain-based PoS validators are assigned the right to create new blocks directly, BFT PoS separates the process of proposing a new block and adding it to the ledger after some sort of (mostly) multi-round voting procedure.

In our previous articles, we already drew a distinction between *[Sybil-resistance mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack)* and consensus mechanisms. While some might argue this is a negligible differentiation, we would like to touch on the topic nonetheless, as it helps to understand the design decisions behind all Proof of X schemes.

In a public blockchain the cost of creating an identity (read: [key pair]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-04-0-public-key-cryptography %})) is effectively zero. In a naive implementation of a consensus mechanism, this would allow participants to create many identities to manipulate the voting procedure on new blocks. To prevent malicious - or *Byzantine* - actors from creating multiple *Sybil* identities to manipulate the voting procedure on new blocks, an "artificial cost" for voting needs to be added. In PoW this was electricity needed to perform the computationally expensive continuous [hashing]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-03-hash-functions %}) of data. In Proof of Stake, the cost comes at acquiring the native currency of the protocol. Other Proof of X schemes like *Proof of Capacity* require participants to store large amounts of data and derive the cost from buying hard drives. The *X* in Proof of X always refers to the source of cost to participate in the decision making. This cost is meant to prevent [Sybil attacks].

Consensus - or agreement - is based on another rule, commonly the *longest chain rule*. It is applied to determine which fork is the valid one in case of a chain split. In BFT-style PoS the longest chain rule is replaced by some form of voting.

### Benefits of PoS

Firstly, Proof of Stake has a significantly lower energy consumption compared to PoW. This is a common criticism with the *Nakamoto Consensus*.

Secondly, Validators are required to acquire a share of the protocols native currency to participate in the decision-making process. This can be considered an *internal cost*. Additionally, validators don't spend their coins to participate, they only deposit them for a certain period. Because no external cost is involved as in PoW, the financial incentives for validators can be significantly lower while remaining attractive. The block subsidy can be lower, allowing for a lower rate of inflation. Some PoS protocols eliminate the block subsidy and validators are incentivized by transaction fees only.

Thirdly, Proof of Stake can provide real *finality*. This means that once a block has enough block producers vouch for it - usually two-thirds of all validators - it is guaranteed that the history of blocks up to this checkpoint will not change anymore.
PoW can only ever provide *probabilistic finality*. The overarching idea is that as a block gets buried under more and more blocks, the likelihood of the block getting reversed exponentially approaches zero - but never actually reaches it. It practice this proved to be a sufficient security assumption. In different terminology, PoS provides *deterministic consensus* and PoW [*non-deterministic consensus*](changing the def. of consensus).

Deterministic consensus allows for a scaling approach called [*sharding*](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ). Sharding is not a blockchain-native technique. A database can be partitioned into individual *shards* that will share some of their data while storing other, less frequently used data only in (a) certain shard(s). Sharding is one of the reasons why Ethereum wants to transition to its PoS based [Casper Protocol](https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper/blob/master/cbc-casper-paper-draft.pdf).

Lastly, PoS eliminates economies of scale from affecting the block production process. Although we concluded that Proof of Work algorithms are *amortization free* - meaning they do not offer an advantage to miners operating on a large scale, this only holds theoretically. While the algorithm itself does not allow for economies of scale, the entirety of the mining process always will. The more miners you buy, the better the price you will get. Cooling and housing are subject to economies of scale as well. This is an inherent caveat to introducing external, real-world costs to the block production process.

### Challenges with Proof of Stake

https://blog.positive.com/rewriting-history-a-brief-introduction-to-long-range-attacks-54e473acdba9

All of the above sounds very compelling, but some downsides and challenges come with PoS protocols. 

Most notably, it remains to be seen if a PoS based network capturing significant value will be as robust as the largest PoW blockchains. By adding an external cost to creating blocks, one can prevent even powerful adversaries from attacking the consensus mechanism. 

We already mentioned that PPCoin, the first proposed PoS protocol did not require network participants to lock their coins - possession of funds was considered to be sufficient proof of having a stake in the network.

Locking up funds is necessary to address the *nothing 


In a naive implementation of PoS, if a block producer were to witness a chain split, their incentive is to add their block on both chains. This hedges their bets and they will collect their reward no matter which chain endures. Unlike PoW which requires expending energy, there is no opportunity cost to voting on all chains. This may prevent the network from converging on a singular consensus." - on consensus. Ethereum to combat this via slashing, punish block producers voting on both sides of the fork (willfully)\\

rational behavior. this is in opposition to pow, where it's not rational to build on 2 chains, wasted resources

 theoretically double spend with 1\% or less. this is a worst case assumption, everybody would need to vote on all valid chains for this case. when she get elected as a leader she'll only extent the chain favorable for her. but the threshold is most likely to be a lot lower than 50. if not addressed properly




incentive alignment by being part of the network - attack on network, coins worth less



3 broad attack types that are talked about most often:



\textbf{Long Range Attack}: In the early part of the stake distribution there can be a few people that get their hands on an overwhelimngly high stake. You can bribe them to make a really long chain and because you can bribe them they just sign everything.

\textbf{Grinding Attack}: There are these random number generators that you need to draw from this distribution. What if someone has high compute power and can sample all the random numbers and basically see which random number seed gives them an edge.


### A Variation - delegated Proof of Stake

"Delegated Proof of Stake is a specialized form of PoS. The difference is that the majority of owners in dPoS are expected to delegate their responsibility. By limiting the number of participants, latency becomes less of a problem and consensus speeds up." - on consensus\\

The DPOS algorithm is divided into two parts: electing a group of block producers and scheduling production.


 First it requires some kind of synchronisation between the peers as it splits time into slots, timing is critical in this algorithm. Then it selects a number of peers among those that have stake (theirs or delegated) and schedules them into those slots in a specific manner. Some are scheduled from the top stake and some from the rest of the witnesses probabilistically according to their amount of stake. Finally that set of delegates is updated every some interval. So now we have time slots and assigned block producers for each of those. The producers emit blocks on their slot and the chain with the less missed blocks is the main.



Like proof of work, the general rule is that longest chain wins.

Under normal operation block producers take turns producing a block every 3 seconds. Producer can only produce in his slot. Producer shuffling, random order. Security based on assumption that leader election is truly random.

(3f +1) resilience up to a third of nodes can be byzantine. 3 block producers, 1s block time: 6 vs 3.

network fragmentation -> largest minority produces longest chain. tie possible, tie broken when small partitions rejoin.

last irreversible block -> 2/3 +1 conf.d

block producers are periodically updated. 

"Existing DPOS chains select a set of unlikely to collude entities by approval voting and then schedule them in a pseudorandom order. This shuffling is not really needed because once each of them participates a single block a 2/3+ consensus can be determined. This is why EOS will be removing the random shuffle all together." Dan

Liquid POS, Tezos. Lisk also dpos style. I don't want to upset anybody hear. But a voting on block based on stake, with a set (fixed or not) of validators belongs in the dPOS corner.
Same with ouroboros.
