Mining is more than just performing Proof of Work. It has very interesting economic applications, from choosing which blockchain to mine, to what hardware to use and what strategies to apply. In this article we want to take a wholistic view at the mining industry. Mining has become a large business, and it would be misleading not to account for this in one way or another.

**TKKG**
This is less of a technical article, but one meant to provide an overview and a mental model to add further information to when it is needed. We will often use the term decentralizing and centralizing to express in which direction a given development shifts the overall level of coordinance. There is no absolute decentralization nor centralization and a system is moving on a scale between the two. When we talk about a decentralizing factor this does not mean it makes the system entirely decentralized, but it moves it on the centralization scale towards a more decentralized one.

### What a Miner Does

On a purely technical level it is straightforward to explain mining. It describes the activity of performing a computationally expensive task - the [Proof of Work (PoW)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-05-2-proof-of-work %}). In the simplest case, this task is finding a *nonce* that when hashed together with the rest of the *block header* produces a block hash below a certain threshold which is called the *target*. The total number of hash operations performed per second is called the *hashrate* of the network.

This type of PoW is called *Hashcash* Proof of Work and was introduced by Adam Back in 1997 as a measure against spam emails. The idea is simple: adding a small PoW to an email does not significantly impact an honest user sending only a few mails per day. Automated spam on the other hand would become computationally expensive because every single email would need to have a valid nonce attached.

The largest mining ecosystem has evolved around Bitcoin, which uses Hashcash style PoW using the SHA256 [hash function]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-03-hash-functions %}).

![Hash Cash Style PoW](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.6-mining/hash_cash_pow.jpg)

The graphic above shows the mining process in a Hashcash style PoW scheme. The block header is repeatedly hashed using a different variable for the nonce. The header is hashed twice using SHA256 and the resulting candidate block hash is compared to the current target. If it is greater than the target the nonce is discarded. Once a miner finds a nonce producing a block hash less than or equal to the target it is broadcast to the network, verified by all other nodes (including other mining nodes) and appended to every copy of the blockchain.

The *difficulty* is a different way to express the current target. The difficulty is a relative measure of the current target compared to the initial *maximum target* that is defined with the genesis block of a blockchain.

$$Difficulty = \frac{max. target}{target}$$

On the Bitcoin network, which has seen the biggest growth in hash power since its inception the current difficulty (at the time of writing) is about \\(1.3 \cdot 10^{13}\\), meaning it is 13 trillion times harder to find a block today, than it was when the protocol was launched.

### The Purpose of Miners

Now you might ask why it is necessary to make block production computationally hard if we want to continuously add blocks to the blockchain. The reason is that PoW is an efficient way to provide *Sybil resistance*. In a [Sybil Attack]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-06-04-ddos-sybil-eclipse %}) an attacker creates a large number of malicious node in an effort to achieve some goal. In the blockchain context, this goal can be including malicious transactions in a block or performing a double spend after a block reorganization.

Spinning up a node comes at a very low cost, so there is not much to prevent an attacker from creating a large number of them. A [consensus mechanism] represents an abstract form of voting on different versions of the same events. If a vote was tied to an IP address an attacker could manipulate the vote easily by creating Sybil nodes. By tying the voting power to external costs - electricity and hardware, interfering with the voting process on blocks becomes much harder.

Not only does PoW prevent Byzantine actors from obstructing block production, but it also protects the history recorded on the blockchain from being tampered with. All nodes following the [protocol of a blockchain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-01-03-a-protocol-to-transfer-value %}) will reject a version of the blockchain that does not have a chain of references form the current block all the way back to the genesis block.

A node with access to the most recent protocol can verify the entire blockchain with all its transactions without having to rely on any external input. It will start with the first block, reconstruct the Merkle tree of transactions to verify the Merkle root included in the block header, verify if the block hash meets the target given the nonce used to produce it and finally moves on to the next block. It will even know independently when the difficulty requirements changed based on the blocks timestamps and evaluate blocks after a difficulty adjustment happened based on that requirement.

What this means is that every computational step in a PoW blockchain adds additional security to its transaction history and strenghtens the network.

![Block Reward: The sum of block subsidy and transaction fees](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.6-mining/block-reward.jpg)

For their contribution miners are allowed to include the *coinbase transaction* sending an address of their choice the current *block subsidy* and the aggregate *transaction fees* included in the block - the *block reward*. After the *block reward maturation period* ends this output becomes spendable. **TKKG: maturation period 99, 396??**

### Mining Algorithms

In the article on PoW we went over the criteria defining a "good" PoW and at this point we would like to recap some of those properties.

- *Asymmetry*: The Proof of Work needs to be hard to produce, but easy to verify.
- *Optimization Free*: An optimization free algorithms means, that you cannot improve the efficiency of performing that task through software or algorithmic  improvements.
- *Amortization free*: This means economies of scale that would render all mining pools besides the largest one irrelevant should not be possible based on the algorithm. Other aspects of mining will always enable Economies of scale to play out.
- *Independently Tunable Parameters*: Certain parameters of the problem to solve by the miners should be easy to adapt.

First, the PoW needs to be pseudorandom so there is no shortcut to taking a brute-force approach of solving the task at hand. This also ensures that the block production time follows a statistical distribution with a constant average, *ceteris paribus*. 
Next, the PoW algorithm needs to have independently adjustable parameters to account for changes in the overall hash power. To keep the block production rate constant as more hash power is added to the network the difficulty can increase. On the Horizen network this *difficulty adjustment* is performed after every block. **TKKG**

$$
next difficulty = last difficulty \cdot \sqrt{\frac{150 sec}{last solve time}}
$$

Lastly, the algorithm needs to be *deterministic* so the verification of the Proof is guranteed.

### Mining Hardware

In our article on PoW we introduced two metrics to assess computational hardness. *Space complexity* refers to the memory intensiveness of the computation, while *time complexity* describes the reliance on the processor.

When a PoW algorithm involves creating large data sets in some intermediary steps this will increase the overall space complexity. Other PoW algorithms barely require any memory as they involve repeated hashing of small amounts of data in the kilo byte range. By concatenating many computations on this small data set the time complexity of the algorithm will increase with the space complexity remaining constant.

When it comes to hardware there is a tradeoff between versatility and performance. A highly specialized chip architecture will allow a very good performance on one task, at the cost of being less versatile and vice versa.

![Different Hardware for Hashing](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.2-hash-functions/cpu-asic.jpg)

The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer offers the greatest flexibility with regards to the types of computations it can perform, at the cost of being not very performant. The graphical processing unit (GPU) is focused on tasks around image processing as the name suggests. It also includes more memory because computations on graphics tend to have a higher space complexity. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are meant to be configured for a specific task after manufacturing which allows a specialization of the integrated circuit depending on its application. After configuration they represent another step towards specialization at the expense of versatility. As the name suggests, the Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) sits on the end of the spectrum on specialization and allows for the very efficient computation of the tasks it was designed for.

In the early days of cryptocurrency mining people where doing so using the hardware they had at hand - desktop computers and their CPUs. In October of 2010 the GPU mining became feasible when the first software utilizing the graphical processing unit for mining was released to the public. People with a gaming setup were now at a serious advantage. Mining started to become more lucrative and hence more competitive so people started configuring FPGAs to suit the needs of the mining algorithm. The last major evolutionary step in mining happened in 2013 when the first ASIC designed for cryptocurrency mining was released.

A number of different "ASIC resistant" mining algos were proposed but ASIC resistance algorithms are a myth to some degree. When a chip manufacturer designs an integrated circuit with a specific mining algorithm in mind it will always perform better than a more versatile GPU.
More realistically, the assumption was that the cost to design and produce ASICs for certain algorithms was just not worth the marginal improvement in efficiency. While this assumption was certainly justified at the time many of the mining algorithms emerged it didn't account for the rising valuations of cryptocurrencies that we saw in 2017. This caused a range of ASICs being developed for different mining algos, including some that were thought of as ASIC resistant.

ASIC resistance was mostly achieved by increasing the space complexity of the algorithm and thereby increasing the memory demand. High-bandwidth memory is a very expensive component in chip manufacturing. A general increase in demand for high-speed memory technology such as [GDDR6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDDR6_SDRAM) and [HBM2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory) made producing relatively cheap ASICs for memory intensive mining algorithms feasible.

The demand for ASIC resistant algorithms came largely from an interest in a decentralized mining economy which results in a more dezentralized distribution of coins. GPUs are more widely spread and accessible than the highly specialized ASICs. There are more people with access to GPUs **TKKG**

The demand for GPU mining was met with some projects changing their mining algorithm, rendering the highly specialized ASICs useless. But changing algorithms mostly benefits large hardware manufacturers as they have the resources to develop ASICs for the new algorith first. By keeping an algorithm, more and smaller companies have the chance to design and produce mining hardware, which decentralizes the business again.

Today, we are past the peak of mining centralization. For a period of time around 2017 and 2018 Bitmain used to be the dominant manufacturer for mining specifc hardware. Since than, their market share has constantly decreased and new players have entered the business.

If you are interested in a detailed look at the considerations around and cost of ASIC design [this article](https://medium.com/@ifdefelse/the-cost-of-asic-design-a44f9a065b72) is a very good starting point.

### How Mining has Professionalized

Besides using sophisticated and specialized hardware mining has professionalized in other ways. Economic principles known for decades and centuries increasingly started to apply to this field.

First, location factors are very important today, as the industry is highly competitive and electricity prices are an important factor determening if a mining operation is profitable or not.

Next, miners started to organize into mining pools. They prefer stable cash flows and have come up with mining pools to share the work and socialize the winnings. Mining pools have a centralizing effect and grant a lot of power to the pool operators. Mining pool software could be configured to exclude transactions involving certain addresses - something that cryptocurrencies try to avoid at great cost. [BetterHash](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bips/blob/betterhash/bip-XXXX.mediawiki) addresses this issue by allowing individual miners to create their own block templates.

Economies of scale are also starting to play out, which is not a bad thing *per se*. A mining operation will always be more profitable when it gets bulk discounts on hardware or electricity and the price per square meter tends to go down when you rent or buy larger warehouses. But large-scale mining operations operate in a highly competitive environment that leaves minimal margins when selling the mined coins. To cover operational costs there is constant selling pressure for these actors, which effectively makes it seem like coins are issued to the secondary market directly.

### Mining Economics

**TKKG:** " Finally, the hashrate will not go up indefinitely because bitcoin halving balances the incentive to mine even if the bitcoin price skyrockets in the next decades." - Daniel Wingen

When you look at the economics from a miners perspective you first need to think of the cost of the operation, than consider the potential revenues and lastly derive an estimate of your profits.

The costs can be divided into two categories: *capital expenditures* (CAPEX) and *operational expenditures* (OPEX). CAPEX are the cost of aquiring non-monetary capital like mining gear, racks, and property (if it is bought).
OPEX are ongoing expenditures like wages, electricity cost for the rigs as well as cooling and property (if rented). Setting up a mining operation will usually come with both capital and operational expenditures but depending on the circumstances can be set up to tend towards being CAPEX or OPEX heavy. [This article](https://medium.com/@colin_/cryptocurrency-mining-swaps-a9abab47cacd) goes through the economics of setting up an operation that aims to mine one block a day on the Bitcoin network. Although the numbers are somewhat outdated, the considerations behing calculating costs and profits are very clearly explained.

The mining industry and the price of a given coin are arguably related to some extend. The hashrate will follow the price, becauese an increase in price will increase the profit margin of existing miners and lead to them taking more hardware live. Additionally, new entrants will join the network and try to get a share of the business. This increase in competition and the accommponied decrease in margins leads to the mining cost tending towards the price of a coin, minus a small margin.

The trailing effect of the hashrate following the price comes with a delay and the delay when prices go up is greater than in a situation where prices decline. Ordering new mining gear and getting this equipment live takes longer than removing hashrate from the network when prices decline.

Without the difficulty adjustment in place, a given amount of hashrate would always produce a fixed amount of coins. This would still allow for a fixed supply, but not a fixed issuance schedule. This is an interesting differentiating factor when comparing cryptocurrencies with gold. With gold, production will increase as prices rise. Less profitable inactive mining sites are reactivated as the expected *return on investment* (ROI) becomes positive and active mining facilities increase the flow rate. This also works the other way around when price declines and mining facilities are closing. This dampens the volatility because the supply can increase or decrease in tandem with price. With cryptocurrencies production is constant and can not display this effect.

An economic term often used in the context of commodities like gold and other metals is the *stock to flow ratio*. It describes the amount of a commodity in circulation relative to the production rate. Bitcoin was the first asset to ever allow not just for a predictable supply and issuance schedule, but also a predictable stock to flow ratio.

### Mining Strategies

Mining is a rather intransparent business and cryptocurrency mining is no exception. Miners can be one of three things: honest, rational or malicious. An honest miner will adhere to the rules of the protocol at all times. A rational miner will act to maximise profit, either by adhering to the protocol or deriving from it, depending on the incentives of each strategy. A milicious miner will derive from the protocol to achive some objective.

It is assumed that most miners are rational, meaning they don't mind following the protocol as long as it is the most profitable strategy. Some strategies evolved that are used to gain a competitive advantage - most notably *selfish mining* or the *block withholding strategy*.

**TKKG: add payouts to text**

![Selfish Mining](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.6-mining/selfish-mining-0.jpg)

The general idea of selfish mining is to selectively publish blocks in order to increase revenue in the long term. Let's assume the selfish miner has a share *x* of the relative hashrate on the network. All other miners combined therefore control the hashrate *(1-x)*. Starting at state 0 the selfish miner is in competition with the network to finding the next block and will succeed with a probability *p* of *x*. When he finds a valid block *1'* he does not publish it but transitions to state 1. If another miner finds a block first it is broadcast as usual and there is no state transition.

![Selfish Mining](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.6-mining/selfish-mining-1.jpg)

When the selfish miner has found block *1'* he continues building a block on top of it - block *2'*. If he succeeds he transitions to state 2.
But the other miners don't sit on their hands in the meantime. They are still trying to find block *1* and will succeed with a probability *(1-x)*. If the network happens to find block *1* before the selfish miner finds block *2'* the system transitions to state 0'.

![Selfish Mining](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.6-mining/selfish-mining-0-dash.jpg)

State 0' is a little more interesting. The selfish miner still has the chance of winning the competition between block *1* and *1'*. As soon as he becomes aware of block *1* he will broadcast his version (*1'*) to the network. At this point there is a tie but block *1* has an advantage. Most miners will have received block *1* first and build on top of it. Just like in state 1, the selfish miner will find block *2'* and extend his chain with probability *p=x*.

Some of the other miners with a combined relative hashrate of *z* will mine on the selfish block *1'* and find block *2'* with a probability of *(1-x)z*. 

Realistically, at this point the chance of the honest miners extending "their" chain by finding block *2* is the highest. This obviously depends on their share of the hashrate but most likely it is greater than 50%, otherwise the selfish miner could have gone ahead and mounted a block reorganization attack in the first place and *z* will be small.
This results in a probability of *(1-x)(1-z)* of block *2* being found before *2'*.

Either way, the system will restart at state 0, no matter which happens in state 0'.

![Selfish Mining](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.6-mining/selfish-mining-2.jpg)

When we look back at state 1 there was a good chance of the selfish miner extending his private chain with block *2'* and the system transitioning to state 2. At this point he is at a serious advantage over the rest of the network. With *p=x* he will extend his private chain with block *3'* and transition to state n.
If the honest miners find block *1* first, the selfish miner already has two valid blocks to broadcast. This means all other nodes will receive block *1* first, but discard it shortly after when they receive blocks *1'* and *2'*. This will lead to the system returning to state 0.

Strategically, the miner will broadcast the pair of blocks with a slight delay. This will give him an advantage as he has some extra time to find block *3'* before the other nodes even learn about *2'* and enter the competition. The delay can't be to big though, as it gives the other miners a chance to find block *2* which leads to a situation similar to state 0', only that there is a fork with two blocks on each branch instead of one like before.

![Selfish Mining](/assets/post_files/technology/expert/2.6-mining/selfish-mining-n.jpg)

If the attacker manages to transition the system to state *n* (*n*>2), he is in a very comfortable situation. If he extends his chain he transitions to state (*n*+1) extending his lead. When the other miners find block *1* the selfish miner can broadcast two blocks at once leading to block *1* being disregarded and the system transitioning to state (*n*-1).

Eyal and Sirer demonstrated in their paper [Majority is not Enough: Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0243.pdf) that at *z*=0.5 the selfish miner becomes more efficient than the network we he controls more than 25% of the hashrate. In case he controls more than a third of the network (*x*>0.33) he is more efficient, no matter what *z* is. He could now coerce other miners to enter a coalition and participate in the unfair advantage of the block withholding strategy. Eventually, this coalition could reach a majority of the hasrate, enough to successfully mount a 51% attack and perform double spends.

The paper mentioned above was published in 2013 and selfish mining has been theorized about as early as 2010, so you might ask why this scenario has not played out as described. Besides the block reward there are economic considerations on a high level.

Miners with a significant share of the hashrate have a lot of tied up capital in their business, even when they operate OPEX heavy. Mining equiptment is usually bought, representing the largest share of CAPEX. By mounting such an attack they would undermine the credibility of their source of income - the blockchain in question - and most likely influece the price significantly. To make this attack feasible one would also have to involve other miners or pools at some point which comes at a significant risk.

> "There is at least one data point in favor of this theory. In 2014, the GHash.io mining pool repeatedly flirted with >50% hashpower (by attracting miners with its zero-fee policy), and allegedly even engaged in double-spending the popular betting site BetCoin Dice12. As the news about mining pool centralization propagated through the Bitcoin community, trust in the system was shaken. Several important figures publicly sold parts of their Bitcoin13.
In the aftermath, individual miners fled the pool in large numbers to protect their investment. After that, no mining pool has dared to come anywhere near this level of hashpower again. It seems miners became aware that any form of market panic can have a highly detrimental effect on their bottom lines." - Hasu, "A model for Bitcoin’s security and the declining block subsidy"

Nonetheless, short block withholding periods are likely used by some pools, especially when blocks are found very fast relative to the targeted block production rate. It gives the miner a slight advantage by increasing his chances of finding two consecutive blocks in a row.

This section should give you an idea of how intricate the mining process can be. Finding a nonce that produces a block hash less than or equal to the target seems pretty straight forward compared to the economic and strategic considerations going into the mining process.
