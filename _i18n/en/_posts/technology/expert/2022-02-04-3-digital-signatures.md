Public-Key Cryptography is used to verify ownership on a blockchain. *Digital signatures* allow you to prove your knowledge of a private key corresponding to a particular address without revealing any information about it.

To create a digital signature you need two components, a *message* (in most cases a transaction) and the private key. A verifier will use the message, the public key, and the digital signature as an input to the verification algorithm. This algorithm will then produce a binary output: either the signature is valid, or it is not. Every full node and miner on the network will verify every single transaction using this concept.

This mechanism is usually treated as a blackbox but we will disect the the inner workings of this cryptographic method in this article. Before we get into the nitty gritty, which requires some complex mathematics, we want to repeat a convention we already introduced in our elliptic curve cryptography article. If you know the difference between a *scalar* and a *vector* feel free to skip the next section and continue with [Generating the Signature](#generating-the-signature).

## Scalars and Vectors

A scalar is something that only has a magnitude. Simply speaking, any number is a scalar. A vector, however, has a magnitude and a direction and is represented by a *tuple* of values. If we are looking at a two-dimensional plane, a vector can be interpreted as an arrow with a certain length (magnitude) and the angle \\(\alpha\\) relative to the positive *x*-axis (direction). This means it is a tuple comprising two values, a *double*. In order to represent a vector in three dimensional space one would use a *triple* of values. One value for the magnitude and two for the direction (angle relative to *x*- and *z*-axis). Alternatively, you can use the *x*-, *y*-, and *z*- coordinates to represent a gicen point in three-dimensional space. Either way you need three values.

It is a convention that scalars are written with small letters, like the private key *sk*, while vectors are written with capital letters, like your the public key *PK*.

It's important to note that the hash of a vector is a scalar. The [hash function]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-03-hash-functions %}) consumes the *tuple* of values as an input, and produces a scalar as an output.

We use the \\(\bullet\\) operator when we are doing multiplication on the elliptic curve. When we are performing regular multiplication of scalars, we will use the \\(\cdot\\) operator. We added this little discourse because it should help you to keep track of what values are points on the curve (vectors) and what values are scalars.

To Recap our previous articles: your secret or private key *sk* is a large random number. If you multiply the base point *P* used for the elliptic curve (secp256k1) with a private key, you get a public key *PK*. You now want to prove to the network that you know *sk* without revealing it, so how does that work?

## Generating the Signature

Generating a digital signature in an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) scheme is based on the [distributive property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property) for point addition that we introduced in the [article on ECC math]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-04-1-elliptic-curve-cryptography %}) earlier in this chapter.

$$
n \bullet P + r \bullet P = (n + r) \bullet P
$$

We get the equation below by multiplying with \\(\text{hash} (m, r \bullet P)\\) on both sides and factoring out the base point *P* on the right side of the equation. This equation holds for **any** *m*, *r* and *n*.

$$
\text{hash} (m, r \bullet P) \bullet n \bullet P + r \bullet P = (\text{hash}(m, r \bullet P) \cdot n+r) \bullet P
$$

We take it slowly from here, baby steps. For math-savvy readers this might mean some extra steps but we would like to keep this understandable for the widest audience possible.

We learned that your private key multiplied with the base point yields your public key.

$$
sk \bullet P = PK
$$

We replace the universal variable *n* with our private key *sk*, and use *PK* to simplify the expression \\(sk \bullet P\\). Lets do this in two steps: first replacing *n*:

$$
\text{hash} (m, r \bullet P) \bullet {\color{red} sk} \bullet P + r \bullet P = (\text{hash}(m, r \bullet P) \cdot {\color{red} sk}+r) \bullet P
$$

and next simplifying \\(sk \bullet P\\) to *PK*

$$
\text{hash} (m, r \bullet P) \bullet {\color{red} PK} + r \bullet P = (\text{hash}(m, r \bullet P) \cdot sk+r) \bullet P
$$

Now, we will replace \\(r \bullet P\\) with *R*. This follows the convention that the scalar *r* multiplied with the base point *P* gives us a point on the curve, the vector *R*.

$$
\text{hash} (m, {\color{red} R}) \bullet (PK + {\color{red} R}) = \text{hash}(m, {\color{red} R}) \cdot (sk+r) \bullet P
$$

We define *s* as

$$
s = \text{hash}(m,R) \cdot (sk + r)
$$

and replace it accordingly. It should be clear that only a person in possession of the private key *sk* can compute *s*.

$$
\text{hash}(m, R) \bullet (PK + R) = {\color{red} s} \bullet P
$$

This is the equation we will be working with from here to prove the following claim:

**If you can provide an *R* and *s* together with a message *m* that satisfy the equation**

$$
\text{hash}(m, R) \bullet (PK + R) = s \bullet P
$$

**this proves you know the private key *sk* that corresponds to the public key *PK* as in** \\(sk \bullet P = PK\\).

Two conditions must be met in order for this to be the case:

- If you know *sk*, then you must be able to provide working values for *m*, *R*, and *s*.
- If you don't know *sk*, then you must not be able to provide working values for *m*, *R*, and *s*.

### Being Able to Provide a Valid Signature

Let's assume you know *sk*.
First, you choose random value for *r* and a message *m* to sign. Next, you compute \\(R = r \bullet P\\). Lastly, you compute \\(s = \text{hash}(m,R) \cdot (sk + r)\\).

If you plug these values into the equation

$$
\text{hash}(m, R) \bullet (PK + R) = s \bullet P
$$

from above, you get

$$
\text{hash} (m, r \bullet P) \bullet sk \bullet P + r \bullet P = (\text{hash}(m, r \bullet P) \cdot sk+r) \bullet P
$$

which we said earlier holds for any *m*, *r*, and *sk* (formerly *n*). This satisfies the first condition we need to prove our claim.

### Not Being Able to Provide a Signature Without the Private Key

Now we need to prove the second condition is met as well: If you don't know *sk*, then you must not be able to provide working values for *m*, *R*, and *s*. In order to provide these working values you would have to solve the equation below.

$$
\text{hash}(m, R) \bullet (PK + R) = s \bullet P
$$

To do so, you would need to break the preimage resistance property (one-wayness) of the [hash function]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-03-hash-functions %}). This means that you would have to find inputs to the hash function, specifically an *m* and *R*, that produce a certain output.

Because blockchains use strong preimage resistant cryptographic hash functions, this proves our second claim. You cannot provide working values for *m*, *R*, and *s* if you don't know *sk*.

Now we only need to make sure a potential adversary doesn't learn anything about *sk* from publishing *s*. The message *m* and the point *R* are entirely independent of *sk*. Only *s* could potentially reveal anything useful about *sk*

$$
s = \text{hash}(m,R) \cdot (sk + r)
$$

but in order to derive *sk* from *s* one would have to solve for

$$
sk = \frac{s}{\text{hash}(m,R)} - r
$$

An adversary doesn't know *r* and cannot derive it from *R* (discrete log problem) as it would be the same as deriving *sk* from *PK*. Without knowledge of *r* you cannot compute *sk* from *s*.

### Quick Recap

To recap what we did:

- First, we used the [distributive property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property) to build an equality.
- Next, we multiplied both sides with with \\(\text{hash} (m, r \bullet P)\\).
- We replaced the variable *n* with our private key *sk* and the expression \\(sk \bullet P\\) which represents the product of our private key *sk* with the base point *P* with the public key *PK*.
- We defined *R* to be the product \\(r \bullet P\\).
- We defined *s* as the term \\(\text{hash}(m,R) \cdot (sk + r)\\).
- We showed that if you can provide an *m*, *R*, and *s* that satisfy the resulting equation, it proofs knowledge of the private key *sk* corresponding to the public key *PK*.
- We also proved that without knowledge of *sk*, you cannot provide working values for *m*, *R*, and *s*.
- Lastly, we showed that you can reveal *m*, *R*, and *s* without revealing any information about the private key *sk*.

## Verifying the Signature

All full nodes and mining nodes verify every transaction before forwarding it or including it in a block. They verify a transaction, or message *m*, based on the originating public key *PK* and the signature, which is composed of *s* and *R*. As we showed above, only by knowing *sk* one can produce a valid signature. Verification of the signature includes plugging those three variables into the equation below and checking if it holds.

$$
\text{hash} (m,R) \bullet (PK + R) = s \bullet P
$$

In the context of cryptocurrencies, signatures are used to proof that you own a [UTXO set]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-04-02-utxo-vs-account-model %}) and that you are entitled to spend it. One spends a UTXO by creating a transaction and using it as an input to create one or more new outputs. Each input spent needs to be signed.

### What the Digital Signature Looks Like

A transaction typically informs the network about a transfer of money or data. The message *m* is to be signed, with *s* and *R* comprising the signature of that message.

Because *s* depends on the message *m*, the verification process is only successful if two conditions are met: The sender of the message knows the private key *sk* used to generate the UTXO's address AND the signature *(R, s)* was created for that specific transaction *m*.

With cryptocurrencies, the message *m* is the unsigned part of a transaction. We cover what a transaction looks like in our article ["Blockchain as a Data Structure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-01-02-blockchain-as-a-data-structure %}).

The digital signature of that transaction consists of the x-coordinate of *R* and the sign of its *y*-value. This x-coordinate is concatenated with *s*, a 256-bit integer, after they have been converted to hexadecimal format.

Here we have covered the mathematics behind creating and verifying a signature. In our last chapter we cover how the blockchain client handles signatures. Each transaction output has a *locking script*. It is called *scriptPubKey* and requires certain conditions to be met in order for the recipient to spend it.

## Summary

To summarize, Public-Key Cryptography (PKC) is used to verify ownership. It's basic building blocks are private keys, public keys, and a digital signatures. This methodology is also used in encryption schemes such as TLS, PGP or SSH.

While there are many different PKC schemes, blockchains use elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Cryptography mostly relies on one-way functions. The first one-way function we introduced was the [hash function]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-02-03-hash-functions %}). ECC and its underlying *discrete log problem* pose a second one-way function.

We showed that multiplication on the curve, even with large numbers, is easy and computationally inexpensive. We also showed that division is computationally infeasible.

Next we showed how an address is derived from a private key with the two most important steps being multiplication of the private key *sk* with a base point *P* to get the public key *PK* and then hashing *PK* to get an address. Because both multiplication and hashing are one-way functions it is not possible to reverse this process.

We constructed the equation used to create and verify *digital signatures* and proved that only someone with knowledge of *sk* can produce a valid Signature *(R,s)* for a given message *m*. We also showed that you cannot compute the private key *sk* from the information contained in *s*.

Lastly, we briefly talked about the signature being included in a transaction as an outlook on our last chapter [programming blockchain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-07-01-programming-blockchain %}).

If you made it this far you can consider yourself well equipped to learn about every other concept in blockchains. PKC is a fundamental concept that opens the door to understanding many other concepts, especially those related to privacy enhancing techniques such as [*confidential transactions*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-05-05-confidential-transactions %}), [*ring signatures*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-05-04-ring-signatures %}) and [*zero-knowledge Proofs*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /technology/expert/2022-05-06-zksnarks %}).
