The amount of time people spend using their computers and phones is incredible! Not only do you use your devices for several hours a day on average, but you also produce a large amount of data during that time.

Much of this data is rather sensitive. Most people wouldn't want to give a stranger access to their smartphone with private conversations, pictures, and contacts. Yet, few people take measures against sharing all this sensitive data with tech giants like Google, Apple or Facebook. Not only do those tech companies collect every piece of information on you they can get their hands on, but so do governments around the world, some more, some less.
