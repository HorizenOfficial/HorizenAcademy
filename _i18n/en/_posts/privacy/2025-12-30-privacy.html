            If you start reading and feel like the level is nothing new to you, just move up one level and find a more detailed explanation of where your privacy is compromised and more sophisticated privacy tools. If you should feel like the tools we are talking about are too complicated to use, or you just don't feel like you need that much protection, just move down one level to read about more basic tools.

        <h3>Our Structure</h3>

        <p>
            The general structure of our content is the same throughout all levels. You will find the same chapters from Beginner to Expert level. The higher the level, the more articles you will find in each chapter. We dedicate entire articles to concepts that we mention as side notes in the earlier levels. This allows you to toggle in between levels if you find the content to complex or too trivial.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the chapter about privacy-preserving tools, we cover different tools on the different levels of content.
        </p>

        <p>
            We designed these articles so you can read them in order or individually. If you want to get the whole picture, we recommend reading from the beginning to the end. If you just care about a specific concept that you are researching feel free to read individual articles. We provide an <a href="{% tl content-overview %}#tab-privacy">overview of the entire content</a> here.
