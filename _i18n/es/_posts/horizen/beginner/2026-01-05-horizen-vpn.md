Usually, you are at risk of having the data you are sending and receiving intercepted when you are using an unsecured public network like with a Wifi hotspot in a cafe or at an airport. By using a VPN you can rest assured that the entire communication between your computer and the endpoint of your connection is protected. All the data you are transmitting is encrypted on your device and only decrypted when it reaches its desired endpoint.

Horizen is working on a decentralized VPN network that will allow you to access the internet without giving up your privacy. A VPN - or Virtual Private Network - is a secure tunnel between two or more devices. A VPN secures your connection just like if you were using a private network. For example, many companies require their employees to use a VPN when they are working remotely so that they can access the private network of the office as if they were on site without the risk of data leaks.

VPNs also allow you to access services that are normally blocked in your region. By connecting to an endpoint that is within the area that the service you want to use is serving you can "pretend" to be there. If you connect to an endpoint in the United States, nobody can tell where the connection originates from. Especially people in countries with authoritarian regimes tend to limit access to the world wide web. Not only do they block certain services like streaming websites or social networks, but sometimes they also limit access to basic information that should be accessible to every person in the world.

Horizen has one of the largest node networks in the industry and every Secure and Super Node is a potential endpoint for a VPN. We want to put this resource to use so that our users and our ecosystem benefit alike. Node operators will be able to choose if they want to support our decentralized VPN solution and will get paid by the users that are using the VPN via their Node.

We can't discuss further details on our VPN solution, but we will update this article as soon as we can.
